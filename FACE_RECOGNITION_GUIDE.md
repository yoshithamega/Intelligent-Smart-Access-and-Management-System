### 2. **NEW SYSTEM (COMPLEX)** - FaceAPI.js with 128D embeddings
- **Registration Page**: http://localhost:3000/face-registration-v2.html

## 🔧 Current Issue

You were trying to use the NEW SYSTEM (v2) which requires:
- Uploading 15-20 photos from your computer
- Processing them with FaceAPI.js
- More complex setup

**Solution**: Use the OLD SYSTEM instead - it's simpler and works directly with your webcam!
